!HELLO DEAR USER!

I would like to present my programm that sorts lines by begin and by end.
Also it has my own quicksort algorithm that is full analogue of qsort in C language.

To start using (Linux) you just need to clone the repository to your folder, open terminal, go to this folder
and write make. Than just follow the instructions in the terminal bellow.
If make doesn`t work use these commands in terminal instead of make:
    g++ -Wall -Wextra main.cpp functions.cpp -o exe
    ./exe

If you want to start using my quicksort algorithm after cloning the repository just use make mysort
instead of make 
If make mysort doesn`t work write this commands in the terminal:
    g++ -Wall -Wextra -D MYSORT main.cpp functions.cpp sort.cpp -o exe
    ./exe

!GOOD LUCK!
